GPU Partitioning with MIG
NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology allows you to partition a single GPU into multiple smaller GPU instances, which can significantly improve GPU utilization in Kubernetes clusters.
Benefits of MIG:
Maximize GPU utilization, especially for large GPUs like A100 or H100
Enable multiple workloads to share a single GPU
Provide hardware-level isolation for better quality of service
Implementing MIG in Kubernetes:
Enable MIG mode on your GPU nodes
Use the NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes to expose MIG devices
Configure the GPU operator to manage MIG profiles

Estimated Training Time
Given the massive 1 PB dataset, the training time will largely depend on your data loading and processing capabilities. Assuming optimal conditions:
With 4 A100 GPUs, each partitioned into 7 MIG instances (28 total GPU instances)
Efficient data loading and preprocessing pipeline
Well-optimized distributed training using Ray
You might process approximately 10-20 TB of data per day. This would result in a total training time of 50-100 days for the entire 1 PB dataset.
To further reduce training time:
Increase the number of GPU nodes in your Kubernetes cluster
Implement advanced data sampling techniques if applicable to your use case
Use Ray's elastic scaling to dynamically adjust compute resources based on workload
Remember that these are rough estimates, and actual performance may vary based on your specific model architecture, data characteristics, and infrastructure setup.
By combining GPU partitioning with MIG and distributed training using Ray on Kubernetes, you can significantly improve GPU utilization and training efficiency for your large-scale neural network embedding task.
