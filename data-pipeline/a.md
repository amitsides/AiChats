Data Ingestion and Processing
Apache Spark and Apache Flink
Both Spark and Flink are powerful distributed data processing engines that can be used for batch and stream processing:
Use Spark for large-scale batch processing jobs, complex analytics, and machine learning tasks. It integrates well with Delta Lake and can read/write Parquet files efficiently.
Leverage Flink for real-time stream processing, especially for use cases requiring low latency and high throughput. Flink can write directly to Delta Lake tables.
Apache Kafka
Kafka serves as an excellent message broker and event streaming platform:
Use it to ingest real-time data from various sources.
Integrate Kafka with Spark Streaming or Flink for real-time data processing.
Data Storage and Table Formats
Delta Lake
Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and time travel for your data lake:
Store your processed data in Delta Lake format for better reliability and performance.
Use Delta Lake with Spark for batch and streaming workloads.
Leverage Delta Lake's time travel capabilities for auditing and rollbacks.
Apache Parquet
Parquet is a columnar storage format that works well with Delta Lake:
Use Parquet as the underlying file format for your Delta Lake tables.
Benefit from Parquet's efficient compression and encoding schemes.
Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
Amazon EMR
EMR provides a managed Hadoop framework that can run Spark, Flink, and other big data tools:
Use EMR to run your Spark and Flink jobs in a scalable and cost-effective manner.
Integrate EMR with other AWS services like S3 for data storage.
AWS Glue
Glue is a fully managed ETL service:
Use Glue for data catalog management and simple ETL jobs.
Integrate Glue with your Delta Lake tables for metadata management.
Amazon Athena
Athena is a serverless query service:
Use Athena to run SQL queries directly on your Delta Lake tables stored in S3.
Leverage Athena for ad-hoc querying and data exploration.
Data Mesh Concepts
Implement data mesh principles to create a decentralized data architecture:
Use Delta Lake to create domain-oriented datasets.
Leverage AWS services to implement data products that can be easily shared and consumed across the organization.
Machine Learning Integration
Spark MLlib and Scikit-Learn
Use Spark MLlib for distributed machine learning on large datasets.
Integrate Scikit-Learn for more traditional machine learning workflows.
Model Training and Inference
Train models using historical data stored in Delta Lake format.
Use Spark or Flink for feature engineering and model scoring in real-time.
Integration with Backend Services
Deploy models as microservices using containers (e.g., Docker) and orchestrate with Kubernetes.
Use AWS SageMaker for end-to-end machine learning workflows, including model training, deployment, and inference.
Data Pipeline Architecture
Here's a high-level architecture that integrates these technologies:
Ingest real-time data using Kafka.
Process streams with Flink, writing results to Delta Lake.
Perform batch processing with Spark on Delta Lake tables.
Use Glue for data cataloging and simple ETL jobs.
Query data using Athena for ad-hoc analysis.
Train and deploy machine learning models using Spark MLlib or SageMaker.
Serve real-time predictions using containerized microservices.
This architecture provides a scalable, reliable, and flexible data platform that can handle both batch and real-time processing, while also supporting advanced analytics and machine learning workflows.
