# Neural TSP Solver using Embeddings

I've implemented a neural approach to approximating the Traveling Salesman Problem using embeddings. Here's how it works:

## Neural Architecture:

Cities are embedded into a high-dimensional space (128D by default)
Uses attention mechanism to learn city relationships
Includes a decoder to predict optimal paths between cities


## Key Components:

TSPEmbeddingNet: Neural network that learns city embeddings and relationships
NPHardSolver: Wrapper class that handles training and solution generation
Attention-based mechanism for selecting city ordering


## Algorithm Flow:

Cities are encoded into embeddings
Attention scores determine city importance
Path probabilities are computed between city pairs
Solutions are constructed using greedy decoding with learned probabilities


## Training Process:

Uses a combination of tour length and constraint losses
Optimizes embeddings to capture city relationships
Enforces valid tour constraints through attention mechanism



## To use this solver:

tour, length = solve_tsp_instance(num_cities=10)
print(f"Found tour: {tour}")
print(f"Tour length: {length:.2f}")
Some key points about this approach:

This is an approximation - it won't guarantee optimal solutions but can find good solutions quickly
The embedding space helps capture city relationships and constraints
The attention mechanism helps learn which cities should be visited in sequence
Performance can be improved by:

Increasing embedding dimensions
Adding more sophisticated loss terms
Using better decoding strategies
