This CDK stack sets up an integrated environment for processing computer vision workloads using EMR with Delta Lake and SageMaker. Here are the key components:

VPC Setup:

Creates a VPC with public and private subnets
NAT Gateway for outbound internet access


Storage:

Data bucket for storing Delta Lake tables and CV data
Scripts bucket for EMR bootstrap scripts and processing code


EMR Cluster:

Configured with Delta Lake dependencies
Uses EMR 6.9.0 with Spark, Hadoop, and Hive
Master node and 2 core nodes using m5.xlarge instances
Proper IAM roles and security groups


SageMaker Integration:

Notebook instance for developing CV models
Connected to the same VPC as EMR
Appropriate IAM roles for accessing EMR and S3



To use this stack:

Deploy it using cdk deploy
Upload your CV data to the data bucket
Use the SageMaker notebook to develop your CV models
Process data using Spark jobs on EMR with Delta Lake format

Would you like me to:

Add any specific EMR configurations for CV processing?
Include bootstrap actions for installing CV libraries?
Add more security controls or networking features?
