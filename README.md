# AI Promot Engineering: AI Building AI

## Overview
This repository contains Chats with AI ChatBot about AI. Using Promot Engineering I let chatbots explain how to build LLMs from the DevOps/MLOps perspective and so they explain how they were built.
They also write python codes, scripts & YAMLs and basically they are coding themselves and their underlying infrastructure.

## Topics Covered

- Vector Embeddings
- High Dimensional Vector Spaces
- VectorDBs
- MLOPS
- Data Pipelines
- RAG & GraphRag
- LLM
- HPC 
- CyberSecurity 
- Neural Networks

## Promot Engineering Focus

1. Build the data pipelines for MLOPS/DataOps (Apache Beam, Airflow)
2. generate YAML infrastrcture for k8s 
3. Handle the Credentials securily 
4. Help with HPC 
5. Vector Embeddings
6. Production
