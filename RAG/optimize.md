Optimizing Performance
To achieve better performance:
Use the Hybrid Cypher Retriever from the GraphRAG package, which combines vector and full-text search with Cypher retrieval queries2.
Implement the "Normsky" architecture, which uses a context-enhanced open-source LLM (like StarCoder) for code completions, achieving up to 30% completion acceptance rate1.
Utilize sparse vector retrieval for faster and more human-understandable results, especially useful for industry-specific terminology1.
Consider using the Triplex model for knowledge graph construction, which offers a 98% cost reduction compared to GPT-43.
Implement parent-child chunk retrieval to provide larger context to the LLM5.
Use metrics and benchmarking to continuously improve your RAG system. Aim for a hit rate of at least 85% for usable results5.
By combining these techniques and continuously refining your approach based on performance metrics, you can create a highly effective Graph RAG system that leverages the power of knowledge graphs and embeddings to enhance AI model performance.
