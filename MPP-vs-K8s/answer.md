## Core Architectural Differences

### MPP Architecture
- Data-centric parallelization
- Fixed resource allocation
- Optimized for structured data operations
- Built-in data distribution mechanisms
- Tightly coupled processing nodes
- Specialized for SQL and vectorized operations

### Kubernetes Pods Architecture
