Key Points:
Shared Memory: The Asub and Bsub arrays use shared memory, enabling faster access than global memory.
Thread Synchronization: __syncthreads() ensures all threads finish loading shared memory before proceeding.
Thread and Block Allocation: The grid and block dimensions ensure full utilization of GPU threads.
How to Optimize Further:
Loop Unrolling: Unroll loops in the kernel for performance improvement.
Coalesced Memory Access: Arrange global memory accesses so that threads access consecutive memory locations.
Profiling Tools: Use tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or Compute Visual Profiler to identify bottlenecks and optimize further.
This code provides a strong foundation for understanding GPU programming and optimization.
