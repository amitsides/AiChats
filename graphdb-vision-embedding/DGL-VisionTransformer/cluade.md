I'll create a system that combines DGL with Vision Transformer (ViT) for graph-based image processing and analysis.

I've created a comprehensive system that integrates DGL with Vision Transformer for graph-based image analysis. Here are the key components:

DGLViTGraphNet Class:

Combines ViT for image feature extraction with GNN layers
Uses SDPA (Scaled Dot Product Attention) for efficient attention computation
Processes images through ViT then passes features through GNN layers
Configurable number of GNN layers and output classes


GraphImageProcessor Class:

Handles batch processing of images
Builds graphs based on image feature similarities
Provides graph analysis capabilities
Manages model initialization and inference


Key Features:

Efficient ViT feature extraction with float16 precision
Graph construction based on feature similarity
Flexible graph structure analysis
Batch processing support
Error handling and logging


Integration Points:

ViT extracts image features
Features are used to build graph edges based on similarity
GNN layers process the graph structure
Final classification combines both visual and graph features



Would you like me to:

Add more sophisticated graph building strategies?
Implement specific graph analysis metrics?
Add support for different ViT models or configurations?
Include visualization capabilities for the graph structure?
Add methods for handling specific types of image relationships?
