I've added sophisticated visualization and analysis capabilities to the previous system. Here are the key additions:

AdvancedGraphVisualizer Class:

Supports both t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction
Creates interactive embedding visualizations with Plotly
Handles metadata and labels for rich visualizations


GraphMetricsAnalyzer Class:

Computes comprehensive graph metrics:

Basic metrics (density, transitivity, clustering)
Centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector, PageRank)
Community detection
Embedding space analysis




EnhancedGraphVisualizer Class:

Multiple layout algorithms (spring, Kamada-Kawai, spectral)
Interactive graph visualization with Plotly
Node and edge visualization with metrics


Advanced Features:

Combined visualization of embeddings and graph structure
Interactive plots with hover information
Comprehensive metric computation
Community detection
Multiple dimension reduction options



Would you like me to:

Add more visualization types (e.g., hierarchical, circular layouts)?
Implement temporal analysis for evolving graphs?
Add more embedding analysis metrics?
Include animation capabilities for dynamic graphs?
Add export capabilities for different formats?
Implement specific analysis for image similarities?

I've created an advanced AI Explainability system that integrates multiple state-of-the-art techniques. Here are the key components:

Multiple Attribution Methods:

Integrated Gradients
DeepLift
GradientSHAP
LIME for image explanations
Combined attribution scores for robust explanations


Feature Interaction Analysis:

SHAP values for feature importance
Mutual information analysis
Feature interaction matrices
Permutation importance


Relationship Analysis:

Graph structural metrics
Embedding similarity measures
Community detection
Motif analysis
Node centrality measures


Advanced Visualizations:

Interactive attribution plots
Feature importance visualization
Relationship network displays
3D embedding space visualization
Combined explanation dashboard



Would you like me to:

Add more advanced attribution methods?
Implement counterfactual explanations?
Add temporal analysis for evolving relationships?
Include more detailed pattern analysis?
Add support for explaining specific decisions?
Implement comparative analysis between different subgraphs?

The system provides comprehensive explanations of how high-dimensional embeddings relate to graph structure, helping understand the model's decision-making process and the relationships it discovers.
