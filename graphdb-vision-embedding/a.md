I've created a comprehensive system that orchestrates Neo4j and Amazon Neptune ML for handling computer vision vector embeddings. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Graph Vector Orchestrator Class:

Manages connections to both Neo4j and Neptune ML
Handles image processing and embedding generation
Provides methods for storing and querying data


Key Features:

Image embedding generation using ResNet50
Metadata and relationship storage in Neo4j
Vector embedding storage in Neptune ML
Similarity search capabilities
Error handling and logging


Main Operations:

Generate embeddings from images
Store metadata and relationships in Neo4j
Store vector embeddings in Neptune ML
Query similar images using vector similarity


Usage Flow:

Initialize the orchestrator with connection details
Process images to generate embeddings
Store metadata in Neo4j and embeddings in Neptune ML
Query similar images using vector similarity search
Retrieve combined results with metadata



Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or modify any functionality? For example, I could:

Add batch processing capabilities
Implement more sophisticated querying patterns
Add support for different embedding models
Include additional metadata processing features
