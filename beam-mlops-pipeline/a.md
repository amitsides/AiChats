Key components of the script:

Data Structure:
Uses NamedTuple for type-safe data representation
Includes fields for ID, features, label, and timestamp
Custom PTransforms:
CleanMLData: Handles data cleaning and validation
FeatureEngineering: Performs feature normalization and engineering
Pipeline Steps:
Extract: Reads data from CSV
Transform: Cleans and processes data
Load: Writes results to output files
Error Handling:
Includes logging for parsing errors
Filters out None values from failed parsing
Statistics:
Calculates and saves basic statistics about the processed dat


This script provides a foundation for your MLOps project with:

Scalable data processing
Type safety
Error handling
Feature engineering
Statistics collection
TensorFlow integration
Remember to:

Modify the pipeline options for your specific environment
Add more sophisticated feature engineering as needed
Implement additional data validation steps
Add monitoring and logging as required
Consider adding data quality checks
Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
