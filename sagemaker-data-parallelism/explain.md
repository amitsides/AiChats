Let me explain the key differences between these architectures:

Parameter Server Architecture:


Has a centralized parameter server that maintains the global model state
Workers process mini-batches in parallel and send gradients to the parameter server
Parameter server aggregates gradients and updates the global model
Updated parameters are distributed back to workers
Advantages: Simple to implement, good for asymmetric networks
Disadvantages: Can become a bottleneck, single point of failure


All-Reduce Architecture:


Decentralized approach where all nodes are workers
Each worker maintains a complete copy of the model
Uses ring all-reduce algorithm for efficient gradient synchronization
Automatically handles parameter updates across all workers
Advantages: Better scalability, no single point of failure
Disadvantages: Requires good network connectivity between all nodes

Key Implementation Considerations:

Data sharding is handled by DistributedSampler in both cases
Batch size should scale with the number of GPUs
Parameter server uses 'gloo' backend while All-Reduce typically uses 'nccl'
All-Reduce requires wrapping the model in DistributedDataParallel

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect in more detail? For example:
