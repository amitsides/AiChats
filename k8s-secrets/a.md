Let me explain both parts and how they work together:
Credential Encryption and Encoding ProcessClick to open code
Let me break down both parts:

data: credentials: ENC[AES256]<your-base64-encoded-and-encrypted-credentials>

This is the Kubernetes secret format
The process to create this value has multiple steps:
pythonCopyoriginal → AES256 encryption → base64 encoding

Why these steps?

AES256 encryption: Secures the data so it can't be read without the key
Base64 encoding: Kubernetes secrets must be base64 encoded because they only accept base64 strings
The ENC[AES256] prefix is a common notation to indicate the encryption method used




decrypted_creds = f.decrypt(encrypted_creds.encode())

This is the reverse process in your application
When Kubernetes mounts the secret, it automatically base64 decodes it
The .encode() converts the string to bytes (required for cryptographic operations)
f.decrypt() uses the Fernet key to decrypt the data back to its original form



Here's a complete example flow:
CopyOriginal: "my-secret-key"
↓
Encrypted: b'gAAAAABk....' (bytes with encryption)
↓
Base64 encoded: "Z0FBQUFBQmsuLi4=" (safe for K8s storage)
↓
Stored in K8s secret YAML:
data:
  credentials: Z0FBQUFBQmsuLi4=
↓
Retrieved by application (K8s auto base64 decodes)
↓
Decrypted using f.decrypt(): "my-secret-key"
Key security considerations:

The encryption key (Fernet.generate_key()) must be stored securely and separately

Could be in AWS KMS
Could be in HashiCorp Vault
Should NOT be in the same Kubernetes secret


The double encoding (encryption + base64) provides:

Encryption: Security against unauthorized access
Base64: Compatibility with Kubernetes secrets format



Would you like me to demonstrate any specific part of this process in more detail?
